Welcome the first Carleton Blockchain technical crashcourse. Over the next 4 weeks, we will be diving deep on the what a blockchain is and how we leverage it to build decentralized applications via smart contracts.

---
## Getting Started
We will be working with the Ethereum blockchain and the solidity programming language.

---

Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Zksync


Contract is like class

Different Types

Struct to make new types

Mappings, List

Functions that modify state of the blockchain

Functions that don't modity state of the blockchain

Calldata temporary

When you compile a contract to bytecode, that is what the EVM reads

Similar to any other compiled lanaguage, JVM languages, Rust, Go etc.
